### Script Explanation ###

1. **Environment Preparation and Tool Installation**
    - The script begins by updating the package list using `apt update`.
    - It then installs necessary tools including node, npm, curl, wget, and net-tools.
    - A new user "myapp" is created to securely run the application.

2. **Log Directory Setup**
    - The script prompts the user to input the directory where the application logs should be stored.
    - If the directory does not exist, it is created. The path is stored in the "LOG_DIRECTORY" environment variable.

3. **NodeJS and NPM Version Display**
    - The installed versions of NodeJS and npm are displayed to confirm their installation.

4. **User Creation and Directory Ownership**
    - A new user named "myapp" is created (if it doesnâ€™t exist) to enhance security by running the application under a service user and not a privileged user.
    - The ownership of the log directory is assigned to "myapp".

5. **Application Setup and Launch**
    - As the "myapp" user, the script downloads and extracts the NodeJS project archive from the specified URL.
    - It sets necessary environment variables including "APP_ENV", "DB_PWD", "DB_USER", and "LOG_DIR".
    - The script navigates to the "package" directory, installs npm packages, and starts the NodeJS application.

6. **Process and Port Display**
    - To confirm that the application has started successfully, the script displays the running NodeJS process and the port it is operating on (3000).

### Execution Instructions ###
- This script should be run with superuser privileges to enable package installation and user creation.
- Use the following syntax to execute the script:
  `sudo ./script_name.sh`
  Replace "script_name.sh" with the actual name of your script.
